### Abstract
> Let G and G' be two graphs on potentially different vertex sets such that a subset of the vertices of G correspond to a subset of the vertices of G'. Given vertices of interest in G, we seek to identify the corresponding vertices, if any exist, in the second network G'. While in moderately sized networks graph matching methods can be applied directly to recover the missing correspondences, herein we present a principled methodology appropriate for situations in which the networks are too large for brute-force graph matching. Our methodology identifies vertices in a local neighborhood of the vertices of interest in the first network that have verifiable corresponding vertices in the second network. Leveraging these known correspondences, referred to as seeds, we match the induced subgraphs in each network generated by the neighborhoods of these verified seeds, and rank the vertices of the second network in terms of the most likely matches to the original vertices of interest. We demonstrate the applicability of our methodology through simulations and real data examples.

### Codes and Experiments

To run the experiments in the paper, please follow these steps:

```{r setup, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
# Fig 1
source("nbdsize/shvary.r")
source("nbdsize/HShsvary.r")
# Fig 2
source("Simulations/sbm_sxrhovary.r")
source("Simulations/sbm_ratiovary.r")
# Fig 4
source("HSdata/summaryplot/HSsummaryplot.r")
# Fig 5
source("HSdata/voi27_seedinc/v27explore.r")
# Fig 6
source("HSdata/voi27_3seeds_Jinc/v27unsharedh2l2.r")
# Fig 8
source("Twindata/itdata_normrankplot.r")
```
